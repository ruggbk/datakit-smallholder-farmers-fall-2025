##### Metacluster assignment of UMAP + HBDSCAN clusters of unlabeled questions #####

Please map these clusters to the proper metacluster using the 'meta_titles' table below. Be sure to choose the best option of the 10, not just the first metacluster label that's a decent fit. If the cluster seems completely unclassifiable, label it with -1. However, keep in mind that many strange clusters that involve things like discussions of sports teams can go in 10: Personal Communication. Return the results in a mapping dict like this:
cluster_to_meta = {
    0: 4,    # Mulching → Planting & Growth
    1: 2,    # Ticks → Pests & Disease
    2: 3,    # Silage → Animal Husbandry
    3: 3,    # Honey/beehives → Animal Husbandry
    4: 3,    # Grazing → Animal Husbandry
    ...
}

Here are the metacluster labels:
meta_titles = {
    -1: "Uncategorized", 
    1: "Soil, Fertilizer, & Animal Feed", 
    2: "Pests & Disease", 
    3: "Animal Husbandry", 
    4: "Planting & Growth", 
    5: "Markets", 
    6: "Finance & Loans", 
    7: "Farming Equipment & Materials", 
    8: "Weather & Environment", 
    9: "Wefarm Platform",
    10: "Personal Communication"
}
