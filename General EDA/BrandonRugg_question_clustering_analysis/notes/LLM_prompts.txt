##### Metacluster assignment of UMAP + HBDSCAN clusters of unlabeled questions #####

Please map these clusters to the proper metacluster using the 'meta_titles' table below. Be sure to choose the best option of the 10, not just the first metacluster label that's a decent fit. If the cluster seems completely unclassifiable, label it with -1. However, keep in mind that many strange clusters that involve things like discussions of sports teams can go in 10: Personal Communication. Return the results in a mapping dict like this:
cluster_to_meta = {
    0: 4,    # Mulching → Planting & Growth
    1: 2,    # Ticks → Pests & Disease
    2: 3,    # Silage → Animal Husbandry
    3: 3,    # Honey/beehives → Animal Husbandry
    4: 3,    # Grazing → Animal Husbandry
    ...
}

Here are the metacluster labels:
meta_titles = {
    -1: "Uncategorized", 
    1: "Soil, Fertilizer, & Animal Feed", 
    2: "Pests & Disease", 
    3: "Animal Husbandry", 
    4: "Planting & Growth", 
    5: "Markets", 
    6: "Finance & Loans", 
    7: "Farming Equipment & Materials", 
    8: "Weather & Environment", 
    9: "Wefarm Platform",
    10: "Personal Communication"
}

########### Metacluster assignent for "chicken" questions

Please map these clusters to the proper metacluster using the 'meta_titles' table below. Be sure to choose the best option of the 10, not just the first metacluster label that's a decent fit. Prioritize more specific clusters-- for example, a cluster focused on chickens coughing is a better fit for "Pests & Disease", even though it could be classified as "Adult Chicken Health & Behavior". If the cluster seems completely unclassifiable, label it with -1. Return the results in a mapping dict like this:
cluster_to_meta = {
    0: 4,    # Optional: include short comment justifying choice
    1: 2,    
    2: 3,    
    3: 3,    
    4: 3,    
    ...
}

Here are the metacluster labels:
meta_titles = {
    -1: "Uncategorized",
    1: "Chick Care & Raising",
    2: "Nutrition & Feeding",
    3: "Pests & Disease",
    4: "Adult Chicken Health & Behavior",
    5: "Breeds & Genetics",
    6: "Eggs & Reproduction",
    7: "Housing & Equipment",
    8: "Business, Markets, & Starting Poultry Projects",
    9: "Seasonal & Environmental Effects"
