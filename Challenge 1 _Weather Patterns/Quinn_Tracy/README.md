# Analysis: predicting farmer question topics based on the weather

The goal of the analyses here was to generate a predictive model to anticipate farmer question topics based on the weather forecast. The predictions generated by this model should not be treated as definitive, but be used to highlight topics to be prepared for.

## What the model is

This is a random forest classifier model. A few weather-related features (minimum temp, maximum temp, precipitation, and relative humidity) are used to predict the topics of the questions that farmers asked. Predictions will generate a prediction for one of 11 question topics that appeared in the We Farm dataset: 'bean', 'cattle', 'chicken', 'coffee', 'goat', 'maize', 'pig', 'potato', 'poultry', 'rabbit', and 'tomato'.

## How well did weather predict question topic?



## Why these 11 topics?

Topics were chosen to be useful while also work within a weather model. All of the chosen topics made up at least 2% of total questions in the dataset, and collectively these topics accounted for ~65% of all questions. Rarer topics would have been difficult to including due to having less data than the other topics. A small number of common topics were also excluded either because the model could not connect the weather data to the topic, or because the qusetions under that topic were broad enough to make it less helpful.

## Future directions

Stronger relationships would maybe be found between weather and question topic using daily weather data.
