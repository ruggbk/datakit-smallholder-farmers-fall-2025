# Allison Sibrian - Challenge 1 Analysis

## Overview
 This project analyzes whether weather patterns can predict the types of questions farmers ask. By translating farmer SMS messages from local languages (Swahili, Luganda, and Runyankole) and combining them with ERA5 weather data, I built a model to predict spikes in farmer inquiries.

Note: Due to the massive dataset size (21M rows), this analysis was conducted on a stratified 0.5% sample.

## Research Questions
- Question 1: Do specific weather events trigger predictable spikes in farmer questions?
- Question 2: Is there a temporal lag between the weather event and the farmer's question (e.g., biological pest lifecycles)?
- Question 3: Can machine learning models predict the volume of farmers' questions based solely on country-level weather data?

## Methodology

### Data Sources
- Producers Direct Dataset: Obtained de-duplicated farmer questions split by language (English, Swahili, Luganda, Runyankole).
- ERA5 Climate Reanalysis Data: Monthly aggregates for Total Precipitation (prcp), Maximum Temperature (tasmax), and Minimum Temperature (tasmin) for Kenya, Uganda, and Tanzania.
- Global Historical Climatology Network daily (GHCNd): Ground station data (GHCNd) was explored during the initial phase but excluded from the final analysis. EDA revealed that weather stations would sometimes stop recording data, creating an inconsistent dataset. To ensure consistent and reliable data, I opted to use ERA5 data in my analysis.

### Approach
1. **Step 1**: Data processing, loading, and initial exploration
2. **Step 2**: Stratified Sampling and Translation 
3. **Step 3**: Cleaning and Topic Categorization
4. **Step 4**: Aggregation & Feature Engineering
5. **Step 5**: Visualizations and Predictive Modeling

### Tools and Technologies
- **Programming Language**: Python 3.11
- **Key Libraries**: pandas, numpy, duckdb, matplotlib, seaborn, nltk, scikit-learn, etc. 

## Use of Generative AI

### Tools Used
- **Gemini (Google's AI model).**: Used to preprocess the 21M row raw dataset, ghcnd_all.tar.gzfile, handle the stratified sampling logic in Google Colab, and perform batch translation of local languages. Also utilized to refine the Random Forest TimeSeriesSplit validation strategy.
- **Human-Created**: All analysis logic, interpretation of visualizations, validation, and final strategic conclusions.

## Key Findings

### Lagged Rainfall (1 Month) is One of the Leading Predictors for 'Pest & Disease' Questions 
The model identified 1-month Lagged Rainfall as significantly more predictive than current rainfall. As current rain triggers vegetation growth, farmers tend to notice pests afterwards.

**Implications for Producers Direct:**
- To create a pest alert system following this analysis, it would be best to send alerts 3-4 weeks after heavy rainfall events.
- To improve on this pest and disease alert system, this model can be refined to use weekly aggregations and intake more data if there are no computational constraints for analysis.

### Strong Predictive Success for 'Pests & Disease' and 'Market' Topics
The model for "Pests & Disease" questions achieved a positive R^2 score (0.18), meaning weather patterns explain 18% of the variance in 'P & D' questions.

- The model achieved a "Strong" performance rating for 'Pest & Disease' and 'Market' topics, meaning that the prediction error (RMSE) was lower than the standard deviation of the test set.
- 'Pest & Disease' RMSE: 18.90
- 'Market' RMSE: 22.31

**Implications for Producers Direct:**
- There is a strong confidence in using the model as a baseline for predicting these topics. This model can be built upon and refined by incorporating weekly aggregation and regional data, which can eventually be used for future alert automated systems.
- Livestock and Crop questions showed higher variance; the weather model struggled to capture these fluctuations. Further investigations should be pursued to understand if these topics are driven by other factors (i.e, economic).

## Visualizations

**Interpretation**: 
Although hard to tell, both big and smaller peaks for 'Pests & Disease' questions tend to occur when there is a high rainfall the month before in Uganda.

### Feature Importance for 'Pests & Disease' Questions

**Interpretation**: 
This chart shows the model's validation and prediction logic 
- Year and Month set the baseline volume, meaning that the primary drivers are users using the platform and the seasonal farming calendar.
- 1-Month Lagged Rainfall and 1-Month Lagged Heat follow, showing that vegetation growth and heat create an incubation period for pests, which could sit at ~ 1 month or less. 

## Limitations and Challenges

### Data Limitations
- Weather and Questions were averaged at the country level. Averaging to the country-level leaves out micro-climates, and limits the model's ability to predict the exact volume of topic question count.
- Training on aggregated monthly data points limited the model's ability to learn non-linear patterns.

### Technical Challenges
- Translating 21.5 million rows was not possible due to computational constraints. I used a 0.5% sampling strategy per language group as it was a necessary trade-off between translation quality and processing time.
- Some translations resulted in hallucinations (e.g., "Attorney General"). This required implementing keyword filtering to obtain usable data. 

## Next Steps and Recommendations

### For Further Analysis
1. To expand and create a robust pest and disease alert system, it would be best to move from monthly to weekly aggregation. A weekly model would likely increase the R^2 score significantly.
2. To expand this analysis, incorporating user location would allow for better forecasting, as this country-level analysis is masking micro-climates that occur in a country.
3. Splitting and further specifying topic questions would help (i.e., 'Crops') as different crops have different weather sensitivities.

### For Producers Direct
Utilizing the prediction model to create a robust alert or high-risk month or market campaigns can be done by specifying feature attributes and incorporating seasonal farming calendars, as Month was a big predictor in predicting 'Pest & Disease' questions. 

I recommend incorporating regional data in the model, aggregating at a weekly level and specifying questions to create a stronger model.
