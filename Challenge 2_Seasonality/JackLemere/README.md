# Project Background

In this analysis, I looked to determine if it was possible to map the farming calendar based on the types of questions being asked at certain times. The insights found primarily utilized the following data:

- Questions Asked: Key words were analyzed to categorize questions by type
- Time asked: The day, moth, year of when each question was asked
- Country: The geographical location from which the question came from

The majority of the data cleaning and analysis was done using Python with visualizations compiled using Tableau.


# Data Used
