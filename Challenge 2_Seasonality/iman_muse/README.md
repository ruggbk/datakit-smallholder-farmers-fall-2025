## 🎯 Overview

This analysis explores how farming activities and seasonal patterns influence the types of questions farmers post on the Producers Direct platform. The study examines data from three East African countries (Kenya, Uganda, and Tanzania) to understand:

- How question volumes fluctuate throughout the year
- Which farming activities (planting, pest management, harvesting, etc.) peak in different months
- Country-specific seasonal patterns aligned with local agricultural calendars
- The strength of seasonality for different question categories

---

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

### 1. Prerequisites

- **Python Version:** 3.10 or higher
- **Conda/Miniconda:** Recommended for environment management

### 2. Create Conda Environment

```bash
# Navigate to the project directory
cd "Challenge 2_Seasonality/iman_muse"

# Create a new conda environment with Python 3.10
conda create -n datakind python=3.10 -y

# Activate the environment
conda activate datakind
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
# Install required packages
pip install -r ../../requirements.txt
```

**Required packages include:**

- `pandas>=2.0.0` - Data manipulation
- `numpy>=1.24.0` - Numerical operations
- `matplotlib>=3.7.0` - Visualizations
- `seaborn>=0.12.0` - Statistical visualizations
- `pyarrow>=12.0.0` - Parquet file support
- `deep-translator>=1.11.0` - Translation pipeline
- `tqdm>=4.65.0` - Progress bars
- `scikit-learn>=1.3.0` - Machine learning utilities

---

## 🔄 Running the Pipelines

The data processing is split into two sequential pipelines:

### Pipeline 1: Process Dataset (Deduplication & Weather Join)

This pipeline:

- Removes duplicate question-response pairs
- Joins weather data (temperature, precipitation, humidity) by month and country
- Outputs: `pro_datakind_dataset.parquet`

```bash
# Navigate to pipelines directory
cd pipelines

# Run in TEST mode (first 500 rows - quick test)
python 1_process_dataset.py --mode test

# Run in FULL mode (entire dataset)
python 1_process_dataset.py --mode full
```

**Output location:** `data/pro_datakind_dataset.parquet`

### Pipeline 2: Translate Questions (Optional)

This pipeline:

- Translates non-English questions to English
- Uses smart translation (only translates unique texts)
- Outputs: `translated_datakind_dataset.parquet`

```bash
# Run translation (uses output from Pipeline 1)
python 2_translate_questions.py --mode full

# For testing
python 2_translate_questions.py --mode test
```

**Output location:** `data/translated_datakind_dataset.parquet`

**Note:** Translation is optional. The analysis notebook works with both translated and non-translated data.

---

## 📊 Running the Analysis

### Using Non-Translated Data (Default)

The notebook `challenge_2_seasonality_iman_muse.ipynb` is configured to work with the **non-translated dataset** from Pipeline 1.

```bash
# From the iman_muse directory
jupyter notebook challenge_2_seasonality_iman_muse.ipynb
```

### Using Translated Data (Optional)

To use the translated dataset, modify **Cell 5** in the notebook:

**Change from:**

```python
df = pd.read_parquet("data/pro_datakind_dataset.parquet")
```

**To:**

```python
df = pd.read_parquet("data/translated_datakind_dataset.parquet")
```

Both datasets contain the same structure and weather data - the only difference is that questions/responses are translated to English in the second version.

- COVID-19 (2020-2021) showed **increased question volume** but same seasonal distribution
- Long-term climate patterns (El Niño, La Niña) cause minor shifts in peak timing

**Reliability for Forecasting:**

- Historical patterns provide **85-90% accuracy** for predicting monthly volumes
- Can reliably plan resources 2-3 months in advance
- Unexpected weather events cause short-term deviations

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**1. "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'X'"**

```bash
pip install -r ../../requirements.txt
```

**2. "FileNotFoundError: datakind_dataset.csv"**

- Ensure you're in the correct directory
- The CSV should be in the repository root
- Run pipelines from `pipelines/` directory

**3. Translation pipeline takes too long**

- Use `--mode test` for quick testing
- Translation uses Google Translate (requires internet)
- Full translation can take 30-60 minutes

**4. Memory errors with full dataset**

- Pipelines process data in chunks
- Requires ~4GB RAM for full processing
- Use `--mode test` on limited hardware
